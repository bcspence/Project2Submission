# Project2Submission
This is my submission for the BIMM 143 Project 2. 

My scientific question is: 
"Can sequence and structural similarities of membrane proteins in the H5N6 and H5N1 strains of Avian Influenza explain increased prevalence and mortality in humans and birds when compared to other H5 strains?"

My scientific hypothesis is:
"If H5N1 and H5N6 infect humans at a higher rate than other H5 strains of Avian Influenza, then the sequence alignments and structure of the virusâ€™ Neuraminidase protein will be more similar to each other than with other H5 strains."
